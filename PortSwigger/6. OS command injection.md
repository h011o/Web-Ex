# Lab: OS command injection, simple case

> In this lab I was supposed to execute the `whoami` command to determine the name of the current user.

* I intercepted `POST /product/stock HTTP/2` to find `productId=2&storeId=1` which I changed to `productId=whoami&storeId=whoami` to get the output as 16.
* I then tried using `userId=whoami` but that didn't work either.
* Finally, using `productId=whoami|1&storeId=whoami` gives us the required user.
