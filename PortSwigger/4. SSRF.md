*Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.*

# Lab: Basic SSRF against the local server

I intercepted the `/product/stock` POST request and replaced stockApi with `http://localhost/admin`. I then found the href to delete carlos and modified that with the stock url again:

# Lab: Basic SSRF against another back-end system

* `/product/stock` POST request was sent to intruder and here we use a sniper attack to find the right IP used for admin.

Number payload is based on the fact that the given IP is `192.168.0.X` and X can vary from 0-255. 

We get a status code 200 for `stockApi=http://192.168.0.95:8080/admin` which I sent to repeater and modified the request to be: `stockApi=http://192.168.0.95:8080/admin/delete?username=carlos`.
